# Architecture Decision Records

Every **behavior change** in moose-tracevals ships with an ADR here. The ADR records the intended behavior and the reasoning — write it before or alongside the code, so it is the reviewable source of truth rather than an afterthought. The full rule lives in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md#architecture-decision-records-required).

## Conventions

- **Format**: [MADR 4.0.0](https://adr.github.io/madr/). Start from [template.md](template.md).
- **Filename**: `NNNNN-kebab-case-title.md`, 5-digit zero-padded.
- **Numbering starts at `01000`** and increments. The range `00001`–`00999` is **reserved** to backfill pre-existing architectural decisions later — do not use it for new ones.
- **Scope**: decisions (behavior, contracts, trade-offs), not mechanical changes. If a change alters observable behavior or a public contract, it needs one.
