# Adopt `docmeta:artifact-evals:1.0.0-proposal.2`

## Context and Problem Statement

The vendored vocabulary moved to `1.0.0-proposal.2` upstream, carrying `weight`, `target`, `runs`
and `model`, an encoded `eval-` prefix guard inside `metadata`, and one correction that matters
here: **`assertion` is no longer flatly required**.

That correction is the reason this ADR exists. `artifact-evals` required `id` *and* `assertion`,
while the page-side `evals` required only `id` and demanded an assertion **conditionally** — for
`ai`, for `human`, and for a bare entry (which defaults to `ai`). So a `tool-usage` criterion, whose
`options` say everything there is to say, had to carry a sentence no grader ever read. It was the
one place two vocabularies described as "sharing the entry shape" disagreed about the same
question.

## Decision Drivers

- A required field nothing reads teaches authors that the schema is decoration.
- Anything that genuinely needs an assertion must still be made to have one — relaxing the rule
  must not let an `ai` criterion through without the text its judge reads.
- The vendored copy must stay byte-identical to docmeta's; divergence is how two schemas drift.

## Considered Options

- Keep `assertion` required and accept the empty sentences.
- Drop `assertion` from `required` and accept that an `ai` eval might lack one.
- Port the page side's conditional block.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **port the conditional block**. `required` becomes `["id"]`, and `allOf` now demands
`assertion` for `grader: ai`, for `grader: human`, and for an entry with no `grader` at all; a
`command` entry needs either an assertion or a command.

In code, `assertion` becomes optional on `EvalEntry`, `EvalPlan` and the write path. The command
grader gained a guard: a `generated-assertion-hash` with no assertion is now an explicit error,
because the hash exists to detect that the assertion changed and there is nothing to check it
against — hashing the empty string and passing would be the silent version.

### Consequences

- Good, because a deterministic criterion says what it means in `options` and nothing else.
- Good, because the two eval vocabularies now answer the same question the same way.
- Good, because the guard on the orphaned hash closes a hole the relaxation would otherwise have
  opened.
- Bad, because `assertion` is now optional in a type that most code paths read, so each site had to
  decide what absence means rather than assuming a string.

### Confirmation

`test/unit/schema.test.ts` pins the vocabulary id and the shipped path;
`test/unit/graders/validate-options.test.ts` covers the new grader's options; and the upstream
ladder (`docs/proposals/0023/ladders/artifact-evals-examples.cjs`) asserts that `ai`, `human` and
bare entries still fail without an assertion while `tool-usage` passes without one.
