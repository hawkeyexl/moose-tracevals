# Execute `command`-graded evals, on by default

## Context and Problem Statement

The vocabulary adopted in [ADR 01010](01010-adopt-the-docmeta-artifact-evals-vocabulary.md) adds a
`command` grader: an eval may name an executable, which moose-tracevals runs over the session trace
and grades by exit code. `{trace}` in the argv is replaced with the trace path — the artifact-side
analog of the page side's `{file}`.

This is the one addition in the vocabulary with a security surface. Artifacts are resolved from the
**trace's own project tree**, so evaluating someone else's trace can run code that repository
declares. Nothing else in this tool executes anything: evaluation was previously pure reading.

## Decision Drivers

- Some adherence claims are trivially checkable by a script and awkward for a judge ("no force
  push appears in this session"), and paying for inference to answer them is waste.
- A declared eval that cannot run must never read as a pass — the existing invariant.
- The execution surface is real and must be documented where someone will find it, not buried.
- The tool is already routinely pointed at traces from projects the user did not write.

## Considered Options

- Implement it, running by default
- Implement it behind an explicit config opt-in, off by default
- Accept it in the schema but reject it in the registry, deferring execution

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **implement it, running by default.** An eval that declares a command is asking for
that command to run; a gate that silently turns declared evals into errors would make the
vocabulary's own example non-functional out of the box.

The surface is stated rather than mitigated away, and two properties bound it — both free, neither
costing the default behavior:

- **argv, never a shell.** The command is an array spawned with `shell: false`, so nothing in an
  artifact is parsed as shell syntax. Pipes, redirects, `;`, and `$(...)` reach the process as
  literal argument text. Pinned by a test that asserts exactly this.
- **Always bounded.** `timeout-ms` defaults to 30 000ms, so a hung or deliberately slow check fails
  its own eval rather than the run.

Commands run with `cwd` set to the artifact-resolution project root (falling back to the trace's
`cwd`), so a repo-relative script path resolves the way its author wrote it.

Four states produce `outcome: "error"` rather than a verdict, because none of them can honestly be
called a pass:

| State | Why it errors |
|---|---|
| `grader: command` with no `command` | The schema's legal "generation contract" state. This tool generates no check scripts; the eval cannot run. |
| `generated-assertion-hash` ≠ `sha256(assertion)` | The assertion was edited after the script was generated, so the command no longer checks what the eval claims. |
| The executable cannot be spawned | A missing script is a broken eval, not a satisfied one. |
| The command overruns its timeout | An unfinished check has no verdict. |

`fill` **never proposes** a command grader. It is absent from `ALLOWED_GRADERS`, and the grader
deliberately implements no `validateOptions` — "a kind without it cannot be proposed" is the
registry's existing contract (ADR 01004). Its configuration is the entry itself, not `options`, so
there is nothing for that hook to check anyway. Writing an executable into an artifact is a
decision a human makes.

### Consequences

- Good, because cheap mechanical checks stop costing inference calls, and their verdicts are exact
  rather than probabilistic.
- Good, because the failure modes are all loud: four distinct error messages, none of which can be
  mistaken for a pass.
- Bad, because `moose-tracevals run` over an untrusted trace can execute that project's code. This
  is the accepted cost of the feature; it is documented here, in the grader reference, and in the
  module header of [src/graders/command.ts](../src/graders/command.ts).
- Neutral, because `command` runs under `--deterministic-only`: it is deterministic and needs no
  provider. A CI run that avoids inference still runs commands.

### Confirmation

- [test/unit/graders/command.test.ts](../test/unit/graders/command.test.ts) covers pass, non-zero
  exit, `success-exit-codes`, `{trace}` substitution, severity, timeout, the missing-command and
  hash-drift errors, an unspawnable executable, and the no-shell containment.
- The fixture corpus declares a real command eval backed by
  [test/fixtures/project/tracevals/no-force-push.mjs](../test/fixtures/project/tracevals/no-force-push.mjs),
  and [ci.yml](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) asserts it passes with `grader: "command"` — so the
  spawn path is exercised on both OS legs of every run.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Running by default

- Good, because a declared command does what it says, with no second step.
- Good, because the vocabulary's documented example works as written.
- Bad, because it is the one code-execution path in an otherwise read-only tool.

### Behind a config opt-in

- Good, because execution would require a deliberate act by the repo owner.
- Bad, because every command eval silently becomes an error until someone finds the flag, which
  reads as the feature being broken.
- Bad, because the opt-in lives in the *evaluating* repo's config while the risk comes from the
  *evaluated* repo's artifacts — it gates the wrong side.

### Schema-only, execution deferred

- Good, because it defers the surface entirely.
- Bad, because the open enum already makes `grader: command` validate, so the vocabulary would
  advertise a grader this tool refuses — the worst of both.
