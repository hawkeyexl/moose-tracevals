# `weight` feeds a reported pass rate, not a gate

## Context and Problem Statement

`docmeta:artifact-evals:1.0.0-proposal.2` added `weight` so an eval can contribute more or less
than its neighbours to an aggregate. moose-tracevals had no aggregate for it to feed:
`RunSummary` carried counts (`pass`, `fail`, `error`, `needsReview`, `skipped`) and no rate, and
there are no suites to attach a target to.

So the field could be written and would mean nothing — the worst outcome, because a schema that
accepts a value it ignores teaches authors that the schema is decoration.

## Decision Drivers

- The sibling repo consumes `weight` through a suite's pass rate compared against
  `target-pass-rate`. Neither concept exists here.
- Adding suites to get a home for one field would be a large change justified by a small one.
- A number nobody can act on is close to decoration too, so whatever ships has to be *readable*
  in the place people already look.

## Considered Options

- Accept `weight` and ignore it, documenting that it is page-side only.
- Add suites and per-suite targets, mirroring the page side.
- Add a run-level weighted `passRate`, reported and not gated.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **a run-level weighted `passRate` on `RunSummary`**, reported and never gated.

It is the weighted share of the **graded** set — `pass + fail + error` — exactly the membership
the counts already use, so `needs-review` and `skipped` stay out of both halves and a session
awaiting review neither helps nor hurts. The exit code is untouched: it still derives from
outcomes and `failOnNeedsReview`.

### Consequences

- Good, because `weight` now does something observable, and a secondary check can report without
  dominating the number.
- Good, because it is inert by default: with every weight at 1 the rate is plain pass-over-graded,
  which is what the counts already imply. The human reporter prints it **only** when some weight
  differs from 1, so the common run gains no second way to read the same number.
- Good, because counts stay unweighted. "1 failed" answers how many evals failed; the rate answers
  how much that mattered. Weighting both would make each answer the other's question.
- Good, because the weight is stamped onto each `EvalResult`, so a `--format json` consumer can
  see *why* a rate moved rather than having to re-derive it from the config.
- Neutral, because there is deliberately no target to miss. Inventing an exit-code rule around a
  number nobody configured would be a gate no one asked for — and the page side's
  `target-pass-rate` is a *suite* property, which is the concept this repo does not have.
- Bad, because a rate with no threshold is easy to ignore. That is the honest cost of not
  inventing suites, and the decision is revisable the day suites arrive.

### Confirmation

`test/unit/engine.test.ts` pins that every result carries a weight defaulting to 1, that the rate
reduces to plain pass-over-graded at that default, that `needs-review` and `skipped` are in
neither half, and that changing an eval's contribution never changes its own outcome or the
counts.
