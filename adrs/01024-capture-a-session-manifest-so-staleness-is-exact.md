# Capture a session manifest, and make staleness exact instead of a guess

## Context and Problem Statement

[ADR 01016](01016-read-the-availability-roster-and-check-the-artifact-that-never-fired.md)
settled what a session was *offered*: the roster is inside the transcript, so it is recoverable
retroactively, on any machine, with no adoption cost. It named the residual it could not reach —
"artifact *bodies* or their hashes at session time, and the git SHA the session ran against" — and
left it for a hook.

That residual is what
[ADR 01021](01021-warn-when-an-artifact-changed-after-the-session.md) is standing in for. It compares
each artifact's **mtime** against `trace.endedAt` and warns. Its own text is blunt about the cost:
"a fresh `git clone` or `git checkout` rewrites every mtime to *now*, so **a CI job that checks out
and then evaluates an older trace flags every artifact**." The heuristic is therefore loudest in
exactly the environment that most wants it, and a warning that fires on every row of every CI run is
one people learn to skip. Nothing anywhere proves *content* differs; mtime proves only that a file
was written.

The transcript cannot close this. Skill instructions are injected into the model's context and never
recorded as text, so there is no body in the trace to compare against — a point ADR 01021 already
established when it rejected that option. The evidence has to be recorded at the time, by the machine
the session ran on.

## Decision Drivers

- **Exactness is the whole value.** A sha256 recorded when the session started answers "did this
  SKILL.md say the same thing then?" outright. Anything short of that is another heuristic.
- **The trace has to travel with the evidence.** ADR 01016's roster works everywhere because it is
  *inside* the trace. A sidecar has to be somewhere a CI job already carries: `ci/index.mdx`
  documents evaluating in the same job, uploading the trace as an artifact, and committing a corpus,
  and `.moose-tracevals/` — where the judge cache already lives — is inside the project for all
  three.
- **`run` is read-only, and CLAUDE.md states that as an invariant.** A new write path has to be
  argued, not assumed.
- **A hook only helps sessions recorded after someone installs it.** Every existing session keeps the
  mtime heuristic, so the new path must slot in beside it rather than replace it.
- **A manifest is written by the evaluated machine and travels with the repository.** It is evidence
  about that device, and it must not be able to manufacture a clean answer.
- **The hook payload is another program's output.** Its documented common members are stable; the
  member naming *why* a session started is not — the reference has published it as `source`/`reason`
  and as `how`/`why`. Nothing load-bearing may depend on a spelling that moves.
- `judge.redact` ([ADR 01020](01020-redact-the-judge-digest-before-it-leaves-the-machine.md)) exists
  because a file leaving this machine needs scrubbing. A manifest is a second such file.

## Considered Options

Where the evidence comes from:

- A `SessionStart` hook writing a manifest of sha256 digests plus the git SHA
- Keep mtime and document its limits harder
- Have `run` reconstruct the artifacts from git history at `trace.endedAt`

What the manifest does to the mtime verdict:

- A hash **match** clears the mtime flag; a **mismatch** sets it; neither answer is available →
  mtime stands
- The manifest is reported alongside mtime and changes no flag
- The manifest replaces the mtime heuristic outright once one exists

Where `run` looks for it:

- Beside the trace, then under the trace's directory, then under the project — first hit wins
- Only the canonical project location
- Only an explicit `--manifest`

What a manifest recorded for a different session does:

- It is refused, and the run proceeds as if there were none
- It is used, since it is the only evidence available
- It is an error

How `capture` behaves when wired to a hook:

- Report to stderr, write nothing to stdout
- Report to stdout like every other command

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **a `SessionStart` hook writing a manifest; an exact answer settles the row in either
direction, and an unavailable one leaves mtime exactly as it was; searched most-specific-first;
a foreign manifest is refused; and nothing is written to stdout in hook mode.**

### `capture` is a separate command, and `run` never calls it

`moose-tracevals capture` reads the hook envelope on **stdin** and writes
`.moose-tracevals/sessions/<session-id>.json`. This is the same shape as `fill`
([ADR 01005](01005-fill-proposes-criteria-at-authoring-time.md)): an explicitly-invoked authoring
command that the evaluation path never reaches. `run` reads a manifest and writes nothing, so
CLAUDE.md's read-only invariant is intact rather than amended — evaluation still mutates nothing,
and the one write happens before evaluation exists, on the other machine, by another command.

The payload's **four documented common members** are the only ones anything depends on:

| Member | Used for |
|---|---|
| `session_id` | the manifest's filename, and the key `run` joins on |
| `cwd` | the project root to scan and to relativize paths against |
| `transcript_path` | recorded as a correlation key — **never read** |
| `hook_event_name` | recorded as provenance |

`transcript_path` is deliberately not opened. At `SessionStart` the file barely exists, and the
reference warns that it lags the conversation in any case. The start/end reason is read as `how`,
`why`, `source`, or `reason`, whichever arrived, and recorded rather than used — the same tolerance
`trace/detect.ts` already applies to `sessionId` versus `session_id`. Every member is type-checked
before it is believed, because this object is produced by another program.

### What goes in it, stated plainly

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "sessionId": "…",              // join key — never redacted
  "capturedAt": "…",
  "hookEvent": "SessionStart",
  "reason": "startup",           // provenance; spelled four ways upstream
  "transcriptPath": "…",         // correlation key; the file is never read
  "root": "/abs/path/to/project",
  "git": { "sha": "…", "branch": "…", "dirty": false },
  "device": { "id": "<16 hex>", "platform": "linux" },
  "tool": { "name": "moose-tracevals", "version": "…" },
  "artifacts": [
    { "name": "fix-bug", "type": "skill",
      "path": ".claude/skills/fix-bug/SKILL.md",   // project-relative, POSIX
      "sha256": "…", "bytes": 812 }
  ],
  "config": { /* the resolved `tracevals:` section, redacted */ }
}
```

The population is **`discoverArtifacts`'** — the same set `fill` authors against — so capture and
authoring can never disagree about what an instruction artifact is. That scope is project-only by
its own design note, which has a consequence worth stating rather than discovering: a **user-level or
plugin artifact is simply absent from the manifest**, and its check at run time reports `skipped`
with that reason and keeps the mtime guess.

**The device id is a digest, not the hostname.** The question a reader has is "was this captured
here?", and answering it does not require shipping the name of a machine into a file that travels
with the repository.

**`judge.redact` applies — to the free text, and deliberately not to the join keys.** `root`,
`transcriptPath`, `git.branch`, `reason` and the whole recorded `config` go through the redactor
built by ADR 01020, built-ins included. `sessionId`, an artifact's `name` and `path`, and every
`sha256` do not. This asymmetry is the point: **a redactor applied to a join key turns an exact
check into a silent `skipped`** — the exact failure this feature exists to remove — while the keys
themselves are the project's own vocabulary and its repository-relative paths, not a place a
credential lives. A secret in an artifact path is a problem to fix in the path, which is the call
ADR 01020 already makes about a secret in a `SKILL.md`.

The `config` is recorded and **consumed by nothing**. It answers "what settings was this captured
under" for a person reading the file. Every member of the section is authored settings, and
`apiKeyEnv` holds a variable *name* by schema decree, never a key.

### How `run` consumes it, and the one thing it is allowed to change

Each coverage row that resolved to a file gets a three-valued `contentCheck`:

| `contentCheck.status` | Meaning | Effect on `stale` |
|---|---|---|
| `mismatch` | The digest differs from the one recorded. **Exact.** | `true`, whatever mtime says |
| `match` | The digest is identical. **Exact.** | `false`, whatever mtime says |
| `skipped` | No manifest, or none covering this artifact. | mtime decides, as ADR 01021 shipped it |

**A match is the one thing a manifest may quiet, and it is not a weakening.** mtime was only ever
asking "did the content change"; the manifest answers that question exactly, so the guess does not
run. The observation itself is never hidden — `modifiedAt` is still reported on the row — only the
conclusion drawn from it changes. This is what removes the CI false positive ADR 01021 accepted: a
checkout still rewrites every mtime, and every artifact the manifest recorded still reads clean.

A `mismatch` is the sharper direction and catches what mtime cannot: a file edited and then restored
to an older timestamp is flagged, where ADR 01021 would have said nothing.

Three boundaries hold, and they are the same three ADR 01021 drew:

- **Never an eval outcome, never an exit code.** The artifact still resolves, still carries its
  content, and its evals are graded identically. A manifest cannot turn a `skipped` into a `pass`,
  because it is not consulted anywhere a verdict is formed — that is structural, not a rule anyone
  has to remember.
- **It cannot silence a row it has no entry for.** `skipped` is not a shade of `match`; an
  aggregated project-rules row where only *some* files were recorded reports `skipped`, because a
  partial answer is not a clean one.
- **A manifest recorded for a different session is refused**, and the run proceeds as if there were
  none. Evidence about another session is not evidence about this one, and using it is the single
  way a manifest could produce a confidently wrong answer.

The one place a manifest is allowed to be *loud* about its absence is when someone asked for it by
name: `--manifest <file>` that cannot be used is an error, not a shrug, because the caller asked for
exactness and did not get it. It is refused against a corpus, since one manifest cannot be evidence
about more than one session; a batch still finds one per trace by convention.

The search order is most-specific-first — `<trace>.manifest.json`, then
`<trace dir>/<capture.dir>/<id>.json`, then `<project>/<capture.dir>/<id>.json`. A file someone put
beside a trace is a stronger statement of intent than one found by convention, and it is the easiest
thing for a CI job that uploads a trace to also produce.

### The hook must not talk to the model

Claude Code adds a `SessionStart` hook's **stdout to the model's context**. A report printed there
would be a side effect on the very session being observed — the tool changing the thing it measures.
So `capture` writes **nothing to stdout when it read a payload from stdin**; the report goes to
stderr, where an exit-0 hook's output is a debug line. Run by hand it behaves like every other
command. This is not a stylistic choice and it is pinned by a test that drives the real binary.

### The plugin fires on `startup` only

`plugin/` ships `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `hooks/hooks.json`, so adoption is one install
rather than a hand-edited `settings.json`. The matcher is `startup`, not `startup|resume|compact`,
because a manifest describes what the artifacts said **when the session began** — which is precisely
the "then" that staleness compares against. `compact` and `clear` reset the model's context without
re-reading a single artifact, so a capture there would overwrite a snapshot with one answering no new
question. Someone who wants resume-time snapshots can widen the matcher; the policy lives in the
plugin, not in the command.

The command is `npx --no moose-tracevals capture`: it uses a locally installed copy and fails fast
rather than reaching the network at session start.

### Consequences

- Good, because staleness becomes **content identity** for every artifact a manifest recorded, which
  is what ADR 01021 said it wanted and could not have.
- Good, because it removes the CI false positive that made the mtime warning close to useless there —
  a checkout no longer flags a repository whose sessions were captured.
- Good, because it catches the case mtime structurally cannot: an edit whose timestamp was restored.
- Good, because the git SHA is recorded, so "check out the commit the session ran on and re-run" —
  the fix `declare/coverage.mdx` already recommends — stops being a guess about which commit.
- Good, because nothing about it is required. An absent manifest is the default and leaves ADR 01021
  untouched, so no existing user, corpus, or CI job changes behaviour.
- Bad, because it only helps sessions recorded *after* someone installs the hook. Every trace already
  on disk keeps the guess, which is why ADR 01021 was built first and stays.
- Bad, because it introduces a second file to correlate. A manifest that does not travel with its
  trace is silently absent — indistinguishable from never having been captured.
- Bad, because `discoverArtifacts` is project-scoped, so user-level and plugin skills are outside the
  manifest entirely and keep the heuristic. The report says which, but a reader has to notice.
- Bad, because a long session that resumes days later is described by one snapshot taken at its
  start. That is the honest meaning of the file and it is what the name says, but it is a partial
  answer for the turns after a resume.
- Bad, because a manifest can be hand-edited to make hashes agree. It is evidence about a device,
  stated as such; the same person could edit the `SKILL.md`, and ADR 01011 already executes that
  project's code.
- Neutral, because the JSON report gains `manifest` and each coverage row gains `contentCheck`.
  Existing consumers read neither and are unaffected; the human and markdown reports say nothing
  extra when there is no manifest.
- Neutral, because the judge digest is untouched: no manifest data is rendered into a prompt, so no
  cache entry moves and `PROMPT_VERSION` does not change.

### Confirmation

- `test/unit/capture.test.ts` pins the hook envelope against the documented shape, including all four
  spellings of the start/end reason, a payload with nothing optional, a member of the wrong type
  being ignored rather than trusted, and text that is not a JSON object being refused; then the
  manifest itself — POSIX-relative paths, the opaque device id, the git block, a corrupt or
  future-versioned file reading as `null`, and **that a redaction pattern matching everything leaves
  `path`, `sha256`, and `sessionId` untouched while scrubbing the config and `root`**. `findManifest`
  is pinned on all three locations, on preferring the one beside the trace, and on refusing a foreign
  session id.
- `test/unit/artifacts.test.ts` pins the run side against a temp directory with a pinned mtime: no
  manifest reports `skipped` with a reason, a match clears a deliberately future-dated mtime, a
  mismatch fires even when mtime says the file is *older*, a comparison happens with no `endedAt` at
  all, an unrecorded file falls back to the heuristic, and a mismatched artifact still resolves with
  its content intact.
- `test/unit/engine.test.ts` pins that the fixture corpus reports no manifest and a `skipped` check on
  every row; that `--manifest` naming an unusable file throws; and that a real manifest clears the
  checkout's flags for the project's artifacts, leaves the out-of-project plugin skill on the guess
  with its reason, and moves **no** verdict, summary, or exit code.
- `test/unit/reporters.test.ts` pins that the human and markdown reports name content identity rather
  than mtime for an exact mismatch, keep the markdown column count, print nothing at all with no
  manifest, and say how many rows still rest on the guess.
- `test/integration/cli.test.ts` drives the built binary with a payload on real stdin: the manifest is
  written, **stdout is empty**, a payload with no session id exits 2, `--manifest` against a corpus is
  refused, and `capture` followed by `run` demonstrably reduces the stale set while leaving the
  summary and exit code identical.
- [ci.yml](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs `capture` over the fixture corpus and asserts the
  manifest's shape, then runs `run` three ways over one trace — no manifest, a fresh manifest, and a
  manifest invalidated by an edited artifact — asserting `skipped` / `match` / `mismatch`, the
  warning wording in each case, and that the eval outcomes and exit code are byte-identical across
  all three.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### A `SessionStart` hook writing a manifest

- Good, because a sha256 is content identity, which is the only thing that actually answers the
  question.
- Good, because the git SHA turns "re-run against the commit the session ran on" into an instruction
  rather than an archaeology exercise.
- Bad, because it needs adoption, and it is worth nothing for sessions already recorded.
- Bad, because it is a write path, and a second file that has to travel with the trace.

### Keep mtime and document harder

- Good, because it is free and already shipped.
- Bad, because the documentation would be explaining why the signal is unreliable rather than making
  it reliable, and `declare/coverage.mdx` already does that as well as it can be done.

### Reconstruct artifacts from git history

- Good, because it needs no hook and no adoption: the repository already holds every past version.
- Bad, because nothing records **which commit** the session ran against, so it would have to be
  inferred from `trace.endedAt` — a guess layered on the guess it was replacing.
- Bad, because it is wrong whenever the working tree was dirty, which during agent work it usually is.

### The manifest changes no flag

- Good, because the manifest could then never affect anything, which is the most conservative reading
  of "a claim, not proof".
- Bad, because it declines the entire benefit. The CI false positive survives, and a report carrying
  both an mtime warning and a contradicting hash match asks the reader to arbitrate evidence the tool
  already weighed.

### The manifest replaces mtime outright

- Good, because one mechanism instead of two.
- Bad, because an artifact the manifest never recorded — every user-level and plugin one — would
  silently lose a signal it has today, which is a regression disguised as a simplification.

### Only the canonical project location

- Good, because one place to look and nothing to explain.
- Bad, because the CI pattern that uploads a trace as a build artifact has nowhere to put the
  manifest, and that is one of the three patterns the docs recommend.

### Only an explicit `--manifest`

- Good, because it is unambiguous.
- Bad, because it makes the feature opt-in twice — install the hook, then remember the flag on every
  invocation — and a gate configured in CI months ago is exactly where it would be forgotten.

### Use a manifest recorded for a different session

- Good, because some evidence beats none.
- Bad, because it is the one input that could make the tool confidently wrong: it would report a
  hash mismatch as this session's staleness when it is a fact about a different one.

### Report to stdout in hook mode

- Good, because it is consistent with every other command.
- Bad, because Claude Code feeds a `SessionStart` hook's stdout to the model, so the observer would
  be writing into the session it observes — and on every single session start.
