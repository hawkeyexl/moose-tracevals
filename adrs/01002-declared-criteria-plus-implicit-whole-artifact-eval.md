# Declared frontmatter criteria plus an implicit whole-artifact eval; drop heading scraping

## Context and Problem Statement

The previous agentevals auto-extracted criteria by regex-matching markdown headings ("Entry Criteria", "Constraints", …) in skill and agent files, and its `--detect-criteria` flag wrote merged criteria back into user artifacts mid-evaluation. How should the rework obtain evaluation criteria from artifacts?

## Decision Drivers

- Heading scraping is brittle: it depends on authors using specific heading names and silently misses everything else.
- An evaluator that mutates the files it evaluates violates least surprise and makes runs non-reproducible.
- Artifacts should be evaluable with zero configuration, but authors need a precise opt-in path.
- docmeta already provides frontmatter extraction with line maps and multi-dialect schema validation.

## Considered Options

- Declared `metadata.evals` frontmatter (docmeta-validated) + one implicit whole-artifact adherence eval as fallback
- Keep heading scraping as the fallback
- Declared criteria only (artifacts without them are skipped)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Declared frontmatter criteria + implicit whole-artifact eval". Criteria live in a `metadata.evals` block read via docmeta `extractFrontmatter` and validated against the published `schemas/artifact-evals-0.1.json` (string shorthand = LLM assertion; object form selects a deterministic grader with options). Invalid blocks are reported as errors with line numbers, never silently ignored. An artifact with no declared criteria gets exactly one implicit LLM eval: "the session adhered to the instructions in this artifact", with the full artifact body as context; the verdict's `observed` field must cite the specific instructions followed or violated. Heading scraping and criteria write-back are removed.

### Consequences

- Good, because every used artifact is evaluated with zero configuration, and declared criteria give precision where authors invest.
- Good, because evaluation is read-only end to end.
- Bad, because implicit whole-artifact judging is coarser than per-heading criteria for long artifacts and costs more tokens per verdict.

### Confirmation

Schema behavior is pinned in `test/unit/schema.test.ts`; planning tests assert an artifact with no `metadata.evals` yields exactly one implicit eval and an invalid block yields an `error`-outcome eval with a line number. The CI dogfood gate exercises both paths against the fixture corpus.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Declared criteria + implicit eval

- Good, because deterministic where declared, complete where not.
- Bad, because coarse fallback granularity.

### Keep heading scraping as fallback

- Good, because finer-grained free criteria for conforming artifacts.
- Bad, because heading conventions are not a contract; failures are silent and format-dependent.

### Declared criteria only

- Good, because fully deterministic.
- Bad, because the common case (artifacts without declarations) would be silently unevaluated, gutting the tool's purpose.
