/**
 * Source files must stay *text*.
 *
 * `workflows.test.ts` guards the same property for `.github/workflows`, where a
 * literal NUL once made a workflow unparseable on GitHub while every other
 * check went green. The failure mode in a `.ts` file is quieter and worse: git
 * marks the file binary, so its diff shows as `Bin 0 -> 4917 bytes` and is
 * invisible in review, it cannot be three-way merged, and `grep` prints
 * `Binary file … matches` and nothing else.
 *
 * The `\\u0000` escape has the identical runtime value and none of that, so a
 * literal NUL in source is never the thing anyone wanted.
