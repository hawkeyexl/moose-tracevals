/**
 * Pins the vendored `docmeta:artifact-evals:1.0.0-proposal.2` vocabulary.
 *
 * The cases are a port of docmeta's own verification ladder
 * (`docs/proposals/0023/ladders/artifact-evals-examples.cjs`), kept case-for-case
 * so a drift between our copy and docmeta's draft shows up here rather than in
 * the field. The migration negatives (N1–N3) are the ones that matter most in
 * this repo: they are the `artifact-evals-0.2` spellings this vocabulary
 * replaces, and they must fail loudly rather than quietly do nothing.
 *
 * Cases are written as YAML because that is how artifacts are authored — a
 * JSON-literal port would not catch a shape that only YAML can express.
