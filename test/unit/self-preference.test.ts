/**
 * Self-preference: the judge model is the model that ran the session.
 *
 * This is the sharpest form of the bias in either moose tool. docevals asks a
 * model whether a document it may have drafted is any good; here the question
 * is whether the model's *own session* followed the rules it was given, and a
 * model grading its own conduct is not a neutral judge.
 *
 * It stays a warning. Bias skews a verdict; it does not stop one forming, so
 * the "no verdict fails" rule is not in play — and erroring would punish a
 * setup with only one model configured.
