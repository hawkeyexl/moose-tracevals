/**
 * Conditional triggers (ADR 01016): `options.when` arms an eval only for the
 * sessions it is about.
 *
 * The point is to make the *absence* of an artifact checkable. You cannot hang
 * an eval on a skill that never loaded — nothing resolves it, so nothing plans
 * it — but you can hang it on `CLAUDE.md`, which resolves for every session.
 * `when` is what lets that always-planned eval stay quiet on the sessions it
 * has nothing to say about.
 *
 * **A trigger that does not fire is `skipped`, never `pass`.** A check that
 * never armed has not been satisfied, and reporting it as a pass would make a
 * green report out of an eval that never ran — the same reasoning that makes an
 * empty window a skip (ADR 01015).
 *
 * **`when` is a general trigger, not one grader's feature.** Every windowed
 * grader routes its options through `validateWhen` and its window through
 * `evaluateWhen`, because `options` is an open bag: a grader that merely
 * ignored an unrecognised `when` would leave the eval armed on every session,
 * which is the exact failure this module exists to prevent. `cost` and
 * `json-output` are the abstainers, and they say so: both grade the whole
 * session rather than a window (ADR 01015), so there is nothing to evaluate a
 * predicate over, and `rejectWhen` turns the option into a loud error.
 *
 * Predicates are pure trace facts, evaluated over the artifact's window, and
 * every listed one must hold.
 *
 * `options` is an open object by schema decree — "validated by the grader at
 * run time — a grader's options evolve on the grader's schedule" — so this
 * costs no schema change and no upstream docmeta proposal (ADR 01010).

 * The three facets used to live in three unlinked places — the name list, the

 * condition meant three coordinated edits, and an incomplete one failed
 * *silently in the arming direction*: an unvalidated key would be rejected as
 * unknown, but an unevaluated one would simply never constrain anything.
 * Keeping them together makes an incomplete condition a type error.
