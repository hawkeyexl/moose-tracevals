/**
 * Grader plugins: modules named by `tracevals.plugins` or `--require`, imported
 * before evals are planned so a `registerGrader` call from outside this package
 * lands before the registry is read (ADR 01017).
 *
 * Loading is deliberately loud. A specifier that will not import is a
 * `TracevalsError` rather than a skip, because a run that quietly went ahead
 * without the plugin reports `unknown grader kind` — a message that reads like
 * a typo in an artifact and sends the reader to the wrong file entirely.
 *
 * The code being loaded is named by the *evaluating* repo's config, not by the
 * evaluated trace's artifacts. That is a strictly smaller surface than the
 * `command` grader already accepts (ADR 01011); the ADR states the comparison.
