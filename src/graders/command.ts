/**
 * Command-graded evals: run an executable over the trace and read its exit
 * code (ADR 01011).
 *
 * This grader executes a program named in an artifact's front matter, and
 * artifacts are resolved from the trace's own project tree — so running an
 * eval over someone else's trace can run code that repository declares. That
 * is the documented behavior, not an oversight. Two properties bound it:
 *
 *  - argv is passed as an array with `shell: false`, so nothing in an artifact
 *    is ever parsed as shell syntax — no pipes, redirects, or `$(...)`.
 *  - `timeout-ms` always has a finite value, so a hung check fails the eval
 *    rather than the run.
 *
 * `{trace}` is substituted in every argv element (the artifact-side analog of
 * the page side's `{file}`).
