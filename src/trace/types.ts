/**
 * Normalized trace model. Every adapter maps its on-disk format into this
 * shape; the engine, graders, and judge consume only this model. The
 * TraceSource union is the seam for future adapters (ADR 01003).
 *
 * Position and branch identity are first-class (ADR 01013): every derived
 * record carries `index`, its ordinal in `trace.events`, so a list stays
 * sliceable to a window after it has been detached from the trace, and
 * sidechain records carry `branchId`, the id of the `Agent` tool call that
 * opened their subagent branch.
 *
 * Subagent turns reach the model from two on-disk shapes (ADR 01014): inline
 * `isSidechain: true` records in the session file, and sidecar transcripts in
 * `<session>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl`. Both land in `subagentBranches` and
 * are indistinguishable to every consumer downstream.
 *
 * `availability` is the roster the session was *offered* (ADR 01016) — the
 * negative space around what it used. It is reconstructed from the transcript's
 * own `attachment` listing records, so it works retroactively on any session
 * already on disk.
