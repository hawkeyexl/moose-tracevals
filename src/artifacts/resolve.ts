/**
 * Say, for every resolved artifact, whether it is still the one the session

 * followed it *as it was then*, so editing a SKILL.md after a session grades
 * that session against instructions it never saw.
 *
 * Two sources of evidence, and the better one wins **only on its own question**:
 *
 *  - **A session manifest** (ADR 01024) recorded a sha256 per artifact when the
 *    session started. A digest that differs is an exact "this changed"; a digest
 *    that matches is an exact "this did not". Either one settles the row.
 *  - **mtime** (ADR 01021) is the fallback, and a soft one: it is not content
 *    identity, a fresh clone rewrites every mtime, and an unreadable mtime says
 *    nothing.
 *
 * A manifest may therefore quiet the mtime warning for an artifact it covers —
 * that is the entire point, since a checkout otherwise flags everything in CI —
 * and it may do nothing else. It never reaches an eval outcome, never moves the
 * exit code, and it cannot silence a row it has no entry for. The observation
 * itself (`modifiedAt`) is reported either way, so nothing is hidden; only the
 * conclusion drawn from it changes.
