/**
 * Offered versus used (ADR 01016).
 *
 * Artifact resolution starts from what the trace *used*, so a skill that should
 * have been invoked and was not resolves to nothing and is reported nowhere.
 * The availability roster closes that blind spot without a filesystem scan:
 * the evidence travels inside the trace, so it works on any machine and on
 * every session already recorded.
 *
 * Three states, never collapsed:
 *
 * - **offered and used** — the ordinary case.
 * - **offered and not used** — a judgement call for a person to make. Counted
 *   by default and listed only on request, because a real roster runs to
 *   hundreds of skills and would drown the report.
 * - **not offered** — the session referenced it but it was never on the menu.
 *   That is a *configuration* bug, not an adherence failure, and it is the
 *   state that is invisible today.
 *
 * This is an observation. It never becomes an eval outcome and never moves the
 * exit code.
 *
 * `discoverArtifacts` is deliberately not used here: it scans the project tree
 * for authoring, and the roster makes a scan unnecessary anyway.
