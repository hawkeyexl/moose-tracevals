/**
 * `target` — which bytes a grader receives.
 *
 * Distinct from `evidence`, which only hints where to look *within* what is
 * graded, and distinct again from the narrowing options individual graders
 * carry. `regex`'s `on: assistant | user | all` picks a **speaker** inside the
 * transcript; `tool-usage`'s `includeSidechains` picks a **scope**. `target`
 * picks the **subject**: the session, its final answer, the files it wrote, or
 * the instruction artifact itself. The three axes compose rather than replace
 * one another.
 *
 * A target that cannot be served is an explicit failure, never a silent
 * substitution: grading the transcript when the author asked for a written
 * file would report a verdict about the wrong bytes, which is worse than no
 * verdict at all.
