/**
 * Fill proposal cache: content-addressed JSON holding the raw, *pre-gating*
 * proposal. Two consequences are the point of the design:
 *
 * - Re-running with a different `--confidence` re-gates from cache, so tuning
 *   the threshold costs no tokens.
 * - The existing criterion-name set is part of the key, so a re-run after a
 *   fill misses and asks the model for *additional* coverage rather than
 *   replaying a proposal that has already been applied.
 *
 * Kept in its own directory: the judge cache has a different key scheme and
 * value shape, and the two must never be read into each other.
 *
 * Storage is the inference library's `JsonCache`; the schema re-check on read
 * stays here, because the library's cache deliberately does not know what
 * shape any given consumer stores.
