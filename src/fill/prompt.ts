/**
 * Fill prompt: asks the provider to extract evals that an artifact's

 *
 * Instructions too vague to test are reported under `needsSharpening` rather
 * than turned into a soft assertion — an untestable instruction is a defect in
 * the artifact, and naming it is more useful than papering over it.
