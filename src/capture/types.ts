/**
 * The session manifest: what the project's instruction artifacts said, and
 * which commit they said it at, **when the session started** (ADR 01024).
 *
 * ADR 01016 established that the availability roster — what the session was
 * offered — is recoverable from the transcript itself, retroactively and on any
 * machine. Two things are not: the artifact **bodies** and the **git SHA**. The
 * transcript injects skill instructions into the model's context without ever
 * recording their text, so "the SKILL.md says X now; did it say X then?" has no
 * answer inside the trace. ADR 01021 answers it with mtime, which is a
 * heuristic that a `git checkout` defeats wholesale.
 *
 * A manifest closes that gap by recording, at session start, a sha256 per
 * instruction artifact. `run` then compares — and a mismatch is exact where
 * mtime was a guess.
 *
 * **A manifest is a claim, not proof.** It is written by the capturing device
 * and travels with the repository, so it is evidence *about that device*. It
 * never reaches an eval outcome, never moves the exit code, and never turns a
 * `skipped` into a `pass`; the only thing it may quiet is the mtime warning,
 * whose own question it answers exactly.
 *
 * Types and constants only, with no dependency of its own beyond
 * `ArtifactType` — `artifacts/resolve.ts` consumes a manifest and
 * `capture/build.ts` produces one from `artifacts/discover.ts`, so anything
 * shared has to sit below both or the two would import each other.
