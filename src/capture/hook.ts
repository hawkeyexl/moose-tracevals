/**
 * The Claude Code hook envelope, read from stdin (ADR 01024).
 *
 * Claude Code writes a hook command **one JSON object on stdin** and closes it.
 * Four members are documented as common to every hook event and are the only
 * ones `capture` depends on:
 *
 * | Member | Meaning |
 * |---|---|
 * | `session_id` | the session identifier — the manifest's filename and its join key |
 * | `transcript_path` | where the session file will be written; a correlation key only |
 * | `cwd` | the working directory the hook fired in — the project root to scan |
 * | `hook_event_name` | `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, … |
 *
 * The member naming *why* a session started or ended is **not** depended on.
 * The reference describes it as "how the session started" / "why the session
 * ended" and it has been published as `source`/`reason` and as `how`/`why`
 * across versions, so every spelling is accepted and the value is recorded as
 * provenance rather than used as a key. This is the same tolerance
 * `trace/detect.ts` already applies to `sessionId` versus `session_id`.
 *
 * Everything is optional and every member is type-checked before it is
 * believed: this payload is produced by another program, and a member of the
 * wrong shape must be ignored rather than propagated into a manifest.
