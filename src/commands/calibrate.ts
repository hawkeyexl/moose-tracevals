/**
 * `moose-tracevals calibrate <traces...> --labels <file>` (ADR 01022).
 *
 * The tool could report what it decided; it could not report whether it was
 * right. This command runs the batch (ADR 01018), joins the results against a
 * human's answers, and reports the three numbers the calibration page used to
 * ask people to count by hand — false passes, false fails, and review volume —
 * plus which eval disagreed.
 *
 * `--sweep` costs no inference beyond the one run it already made: a judged
 * eval's consensus carries the whole `JudgeRun[]`, so a different zone
 * threshold or a smaller ensemble is arithmetic over verdicts already on disk.
 * Read-only throughout — labels, traces, and artifacts are never written.
