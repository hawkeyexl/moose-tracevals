/**
 * `moose-tracevals run <trace...>` — evaluate many traces in one process and
 * report rates rather than a single verdict (ADR 01018).
 *
 * `runRun` stays the single-trace path and is untouched; this wraps the seams
 * it exposes. The reason a wrapper is not enough on its own is money: the judge
 * carries the cost budget, so it is built **once** by `prepareRun` and shared
 * across every trace. Building one per trace would make `maxCostUsd` a cap on
 * the largest trace instead of on the run, and a fifty-trace batch would bill
 * fifty times the configured ceiling while every report claimed to respect it.
