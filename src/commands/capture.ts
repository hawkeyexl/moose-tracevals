/**
 * `moose-tracevals capture` — record what the project's instruction artifacts
 * said, and at which commit, at the moment a session started (ADR 01024).
 *
 * **This is the one write path `run` never takes.** CLAUDE.md states that
 * evaluation is read-only, so the manifest is written by a separate,
 * explicitly-invoked command — the same shape as `fill`. `run` only ever reads
 * a manifest, and degrades cleanly when there is none.
 *
 * Designed to be wired to a `SessionStart` hook, which constrains it in two
 * ways that are not obvious:
 *
 *  - **Nothing goes to stdout in hook mode.** Claude Code adds a
 *    SessionStart hook's stdout to the model's context, so a report printed
 *    there would be a side effect on the very session being observed. In hook
 *    mode the report goes to stderr, where an exit-0 hook's output is a debug
 *    line and nothing more.
 *  - **The transcript is never read.** `transcript_path` is recorded as a
 *    correlation key only. At SessionStart the file barely exists, and the
 *    reference warns that it lags the conversation in any case.
